# Interval Timer

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

An interval timer project for new developers. At this point in the project, junior developers are expected to refactor, style, add new features, and in general, make it their own.

## Bugs

There are intentional bugs for trouble-shooting. The current app works as intended, but also as unintended. Juniors are expected to review the code as a user and try to break it.

## Deployment
